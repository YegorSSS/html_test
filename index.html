			<h2>FAQ</h2>
			<p><b>Why are my contributions not showing up on my profile?</b></p>
			<p>Your profile contributions graph is a record of contributions you've made to GitHub repositories. Contributions are only counted if they meet certain criteria. In some cases, we may need to rebuild your graph in order for contributions to appear.</p>
			<p><b>Why is Git always asking for my password?</b></p>
			<p>If Git prompts you for a username and password every time you try to interact with GitHub, you're probably using the HTTPS clone URL for your repository.</p>
			<p><b>Do you have custom plans?</b></p>
			<p>GitHub does not offer any custom plans. Our plans and pricing are structured so we can provide all the services that support our awesome community.</p>
			<p><b>How do I access my organization account?</b></p>
			<p>To access an organization that you're a member of, you must sign in to your personal user account.</p>
